## Practical Usage Guidance (Non-Legal Summary)

- **Free use (including production)** is intended for:
  - personal/private non-commercial projects,
  - nonprofits (mission use, not primarily for the benefit of a for-profit),
  - academic/educational/research use (schools, universities, public labs),
  - open-source projects that do not sell, license for a fee, or commercially offer Liquefy itself (or Liquefy-powered functionality).
- **Commercial / for-profit use** requires a commercial license from Parad0x Labs.
- **Commercial use** includes use by or for the benefit of a for-profit entity, internal business operations, hosted/SaaS/API offerings, embedding/bundling in a product or service, monetized \"open-source\" wrappers/managed offerings built on Liquefy, and work delivered for a paying client.
- **Decode-only recovery**: intended to remain available so data is not hostage.

## Why This File Exists

This file provides a short, discoverable pointer for operators and integrators (including plugin developers) who need to quickly understand where to find:

- the legal license text
- commercial usage guidance
- contact path for licensing
- practical examples of what is free vs commercial

If this file conflicts with `LICENSE`, the `LICENSE` file prevails.
