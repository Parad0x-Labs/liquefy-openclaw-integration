--- [ 1. PUBLIC INTERFACE & SECURITY POSTURE ] ---

1.1 CLI WRAPPER (./liquefy)
    - Logic: Hardened Bash CLI to orchestrate the secure decoding appliance.
    - Security Boundary: Ensures air-gapped, read-only, least-privilege execution.
    - Commands: [version, verify, decompress, search].

1.2 PUBLIC APPLIANCE DEFINITION
    - Architecture: Multi-stage Docker build (Forge & Shell).
    - Hardening: Entrypoint strictly whitelists public commands and enforces
      execution safety policies to prevent unauthorized runtime hooks.
    - Identity: Runs as a non-root, isolated system user.

1.3 DOCUMENTATION & PROOF
    - Interface Contracts: Stable I/O definitions for automation.
    - Verification Report: Audited 100% success rate across 23 engine paths.
    - Proof-Pack: Hash-locked samples for local validation of Bit-Perfect Identity.

--- [ 2. WHAT IS SEALED (PRIVATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) ] ---

2.1 AUTHENTICATED ENCRYPTION (THE FORTRESS)
    - Architecture: Multi-tenant isolated cryptographic envelope.
    - Compliance: Designed for SOC 2 and FedRAMP grade data protection.
    - Verification: Mandatory authenticity check performed BEFORE decryption.

2.2 CONDUCTION CONTAINER (THE VALVE)
    - Logic: Proprietary container layout and dynamic engine routing.
    - Conduction: Automated navigation of compressed frames and search indices.

2.3 MULTI-ENGINE RECONSTRUCTION CORE
    - Fleet: Unified recovery logic for all 23 specialized conduction engines.
    - Features: Semantic reassembly of shredded columnar fragments and
      recursive unflattening of complex nested structures (JSON/K8s).

--- [ 3. WHAT IS NOT PUBLIC ] ---

3.1 ENCODER DECISION KERNELS
    - The "Shredding" logic: How raw data is parsed and optimized.
    - Kernel Selection: Autonomous heuristics for engine picking.

3.2 ORCHESTRATOR INTELLIGENCE
    - The autonomous management of fleet resources and conduction priorities.

3.3 ADVANCED SEARCH EXECUTION
    - Bitwise conduction logic for high-speed queries on compressed blobs.
